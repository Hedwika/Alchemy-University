  "description": "The flow: 1) Open a terminal 2) Run `cd Desktop`, then create a new folder via `mkdir au-hardhat-practice`, then move into that newly-created folder by running `cd au-hardhat-practice` 2) Once you are in the au-hardhat-practice folder, in your terminal run `npm init -y` to initialize a package.json 4) Run `npm i hardhat` 5) Run `npm i dotenv` 6) Run `touch .env` in order to create a .env file at the root-level of your project, then populate it with important data and save 7) Run `npx hardhat` which will initialize a brand new Hardhat project 8) We recommend the following flow: Choose the current root > YES to the .gitignore > YES to install the sample project's dependencies 9) Add `require(‘dotenv’).config()` at the top of your hardhat.config.js file 10) Add networks flag to hardhat.config.js, add your Alchemy RPC URL under url and your testnet private key under accounts 11) Set up your scripts and contracts, then deploy in a flash! ⚡️",
